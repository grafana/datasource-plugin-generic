## Simple JSON Datasource - a generic backend datasource

More documentation about datasource plugins can be found in the [Docs](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/docs/sources/plugins/datasources.md)

Its also serves as an living example implementation of a datasource.

Your backend needs to implement 4 urls:

 * "/" Should return 200 ok. Used for "Test connection" on the datasource config page.
 * "/search" Used by the find metric options on the query tab in panels
 * "/query" Should return metrics based on input
 * "/annotations" should return annotations
 
### Using a filter for the /search url
The optional filter field can be used to pass some data to the remote server in the POST query. The field content is stored *as is* in the POST query
Template is supported in the filter field.
