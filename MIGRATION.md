# Migration Guide

This plugin is now deprecated and **no longer maintained** by the Grafana team. You can use [Grafana Infinity data source plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource/) as an alternative for connecting to JSON/CSV/XML/GraphQL endpoints. Refer the migration guide [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-infinity-datasource/discussions/740), if you still prefer connecting to existing grafana simple JSON backend server implementation. This deprecation means that this plugin won't receive any feature updates or bug fixes. After 6 months (End of June 2024), the plugin will reach EOL and the repository will be archived.
